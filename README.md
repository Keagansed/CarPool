### Security Issues

As developers with the greatest concern for your safety, we understand the risks involved when travelling with potential strangers. Therefore, we intend to implement an Authentication System whereby users are required to provide proof of their identity as well as their drivers license if the user will be driving. Checks will be performed in order to validate the provided Identity Document and driver's license.

## Quick Start

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instructions before proceeding.

Once all the dependencies are installed,  ensure that your are in the `\CarPool\client\` directory then run the [`npm run local`] command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This will start the server, and automatically open the CarPool web application in your browser.

## Philosophy

Many of us have been in situations where we need to be somewhere but we simply do not have the means to get there. At CarPool, our philosophy is to provide the community with the means to band together, in order to solve a common problem. CarPool will be a unique application that differentiates itself from other competitors, such as Uber, by exposing the good in people. Rather than creating a "corporate environment" for users to do business, CarPool provides a platform for users to simply help each other out.

## Tests

To run the test suite, install the dependencies as described in [installation](#installation), once that is complete, run the [`npm test`] command:

```bash
	$ npm test
```
